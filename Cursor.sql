/*A cursor in SQL Server is a database object that allows us to retrieve each row at a time and manipulate its data. 
A cursor is nothing more than a pointer to a row.
The SQL Server
cursor's purpose is to update the data row by row, change it, or perform calculations 
that are not possible when we retrieve all records at once. */

Life Cycle of the cursor

1: Declare Cursor
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR  
    FOR select_statement;  

2: Open Cursor
OPEN cursor_name;  

3: Fetch Cursor
FETCH NEXT FROM cursor INTO variable_list;  

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0    
    BEGIN  
        FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_name;

Types of Cursors in SQL Server
The following are the different types of cursors in SQL Server listed below:

Static Cursors
Dynamic Cursors
Forward-Only Cursors
Keyset Cursors

Static Cursors
The result set shown by the static cursor is always the same as when the cursor was first opened. 
Since the static cursor will store the result in tempdb, they are always read-only.
We can use the static cursor to move both forward and backward.

Dynamic Cursors
The dynamic cursors are opposite to the static cursors that allow us to perform the data updation, deletion, and insertion operations while the cursor is open. 
It is scrollable by default. It can detect all changes made to the rows, order, and values in the result set, whether the changes occur inside the cursor or outside the cursor. 
Outside the cursor, we cannot see the updates until they are committed.

Forward-Only Cursors
It is the default and fastest cursor type among all cursors.
It is called a forward-only cursor because it moves only forward through the result set. 
This cursor doesn't support scrolling. 
It can only retrieve rows from the beginning to the end of the result set.
The Forward-Only cursors are three categorize into three types: 
-Forward_Only Keyset
-Forward_Only Static
-Fast_Forward

Keyset Driven Cursors
This cursor functionality lies between a static and a dynamic cursor regarding its ability to detect changes. 
It can't always detect changes in the result set's membership and order like a static cursor. 
It can detect changes in the result set's rows values as like a dynamic cursor. It can only move from the first to last and last to the first row. 
The order and the membership are fixed whenever this cursor is opened.*/

/*
Limitations of SQL Server Cursor
A cursor has some limitations so that it should always use only when there is no option except the cursor.
These limitations are:
Cursor consumes network resources by requiring a network roundtrip each time it fetches a record.

A cursor is a memory resident set of pointers, which means it takes some memory that other processes could use on our machine.

It imposes locks on a portion of the table or the entire table when processing data.

The cursor's performance and speed are slower because they update table records one row at a time.

Cursors are quicker than while loops, but they do have more overhead.

The number of rows and columns brought into the cursor is another aspect that affects cursor speed. 

It refers to how much time it takes to open your cursor and execute a fetch statement.*/

/*
How can we avoid cursors?
The main job of cursors is to traverse the table row by row. The easiest way to avoid cursors are given below:

Using the SQL while loop

The easiest way to avoid the use of a cursor is by using a while loop that allows the inserting of a result set into the temporary table.

User-defined functions

Sometimes cursors are used to calculate the resultant row set. We can accomplish this by using a user-defined function that meets the requirements.

Using Joins

Join processes only those columns that meet the specified condition and thus reduces the lines of code that give faster performance than 
cursors in case huge records need to be processed.*/
